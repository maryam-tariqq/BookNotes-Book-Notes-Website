# BookNotes-Book-Notes-Website
This is my personalized book review website which shows my take on literature. I can write new reviews, update previous ones and delete reviews as well.
It has no authentication added as of now so other users can also write their reviews here.
I used OpenLibrary API for book covers and for isbn numbers handled at the backend
